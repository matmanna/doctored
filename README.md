## üí¨ About

Made using Jekyll and Tailwind following the [Tonic](https://tonic.hackclub.com) starter guide and [template](https://github.com/hackclub/tonic-starter). No other jekyll theme really felt like it matched what I would have wanted so I created my own!

**üí´ Feature highlights:**

- 20+ color schemes & dark/light/system modes
- Projects, blog, now, and contact pages
- GFM support (tables, admonitions, etc.)
- Git metadata access
- Table of Contents (floating)
- Side & foot notes
- RSS feed & sitemap
- Responsive nav, footer sections

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Developing a site with doctored requires having Ruby, RubyGems, GCC, Make Bundle, Python, Node.js, and npm installed on your system.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to develop. Run `npm run build` to build. Postinstall and other scripts have been configured to use `bundle install`, `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`, and `bundle exec jekyll build` respectively.

### üñºÔ∏è Formatting posts

To post a new post, run `npm run post markdown_file_path_in__drafts`, which formats it with side/foot notes then moves it to `_posts/` (or root if page!)

Based on [@JacobU](https://github.com/jacobu)'s `postMarkdown` python script, doctored supports writing your posts/pages in a simple markdown file within `_drafts` before running the `post` script to format it in the following ways:

- **Foot/sidenotes:**

  To add a foot/side note, include the following in your draft markdown:
  ```html
  <small>Richly-formatted (html) content of note</small>
  ```
