## Inspiration

The idea for doctored was taken from seeing so many amazing blogs which have their own distinctive, refined personalities. These include:

- Alex Plescan's AMAZING hugo-based [blog](https://alexplescan.com/)
- Noel Berry's creative gamedev [page](https://noelberry.ca/index.html)
- Mahad Kalan's elegant astro [site](https://skyfall.dev/)
- the Quartz obsidian plugin theme
- the lualine neovim plugin
- and many more who I will make sure to acknowledge later!
